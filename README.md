A lightweight **PURL (Persistent URL) resolver** written in PHP, developed during the  
[BioHackathon Japan 2025](https://2025.biohackathon.org/).

This resolver powers the [DSMZ Digital Diversity](https://www.dsmz.de/) PURL service:  
üëâ <https://purl.dsmz.de/>

It handles:

- **Redirects** from persistent identifiers to the actual resource pages (e.g. BacDive, MediaDive, BRENDA).
- **Schema term resolution**: IRIs such as  
  `https://purl.dsmz.de/schema/Strain` return either human-readable HTML docs or machine-readable RDF (Turtle, JSON-LD, RDF/XML) via HTTP content negotiation.
- **Catch-alls** for resources without explicit landing pages, ensuring every PURL resolves consistently.

## üöÄ Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies via Composer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/purl-resolver.git
cd purl-resolver
composer install
```

That‚Äôs it ‚Äî the resolver is now ready to serve via PHP‚Äôs built-in webserver, Apache, or Nginx with PHP-FPM.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

### Local development (PHP built-in server)

```bash
php -S localhost:8080 index.php
```

Now open:
- http://localhost:8080/bacdive/strain/123 ‚Üí redirects to BacDive.
- http://localhost:8080/schema/Strain ‚Üí renders the ontology term Strain as HTML.
- Add Accept: text/turtle / application/ld+json / application/rdf+xml headers to get RDF serializations.

### Deployment
- Point your webserver (Apache or Nginx) at the public/ or repo root where index.php lives.
- Ensure PHP 8.1+ and Composer dependencies are available.
- Configure HTTPS + reverse proxy headers if deploying behind a gateway.

## üß© Configuration

All resolver logic is controlled by config.php:
- `base_url`: base path if not at root, do not forget to update .htaccess if changed.
- `redirects`: regex rules mapping PURLs to their landing pages.
- `ontology`: path to your ontology file (.ttl or .nt) and base IRI.
- `rdf_mime_map`: MIME types ‚Üí EasyRdf serializers.

**Examples:**
```php
'redirects' => [
  '#^/bacdive/strain/(\d+)$#' => 'https://bacdive.dsmz.de/strain/$1',
  '#^/mediadive/ingredient/(\d+)$#' => 'https://mediadive.dsmz.de/ingredients/$1',
  '#^/brenda/ec/(\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+)$#' => 'https://brenda-enzymes.org/enzyme.php?ecno=$1',
],
```


## üß™ Testing

Use curl to check content negotiation:

```bash
curl -H "Accept: text/turtle"      http://localhost:8080/schema/Strain
curl -H "Accept: application/ld+json" http://localhost:8080/schema/Strain
curl -H "Accept: application/rdf+xml" http://localhost:8080/schema/Strain
```
