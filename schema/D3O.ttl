This ontology provides a structured framework to represent various aspects of microbial data, including taxonomic information, strain properties, cultivation conditions, and media links. D3O facilitates cross-referencing between internal DSMZ datasets and external biological resources, supporting enhanced data discovery, interoperability, and research in microbiology, genomics, and metabolomics. The ontology includes both object properties, which link entities such as bacterial strains to external resources (e.g., literature references or media descriptions), and data properties, which associate entities with literal values (e.g., taxonomic identifiers, growth conditions). Designed for use in RDF-based knowledge graphs, D3O supports flexible integration with other life science ontologies, promoting consistency and reuse in the broader scientific community."@en ;
